# ⚙️ Pipelined Processor

This project implements a basic **4-stage pipelined processor** using Verilog HDL. The processor supports a simplified instruction set with operations like `ADD`, `SUB`, and `LOAD`, mimicking the fundamental architecture of a real-world CPU. The main objective is to demonstrate instruction pipelining, where multiple instructions are overlapped in execution to improve throughput.

The pipeline consists of the following stages:
1. **Instruction Fetch (IF)** – Fetch the instruction from memory.
2. **Instruction Decode (ID)** – Decode the instruction and read operand registers.
3. **Execute (EX)** – Perform the arithmetic or memory operation.
4. **Write Back (WB)** – Write the result back to the destination register.
